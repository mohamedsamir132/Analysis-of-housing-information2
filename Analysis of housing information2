# Terminology survey
'''
Kurtosis describes the peakedness of the distribution
· Along with skewness, kurtosis is an important descriptive statistic of data distribution. 
However, the two concepts must not be confused with each other. 
Skewness essentially measures the symmetry of the distribution, 
while kurtosis determines the heaviness of the distribution tails.
· It is the sharpness of the peak of a frequency-distribution curve .It is actually the measure of outliers present in the distribution.
· High kurtosis in a data set is an indicator that data has heavy outliers.
· Low kurtosis in a data set is an indicator that data has lack of outliers.
'''

kurtosis = data.kurtosis(axis=0)
print('kurtosis: {}'.format(kurtosis))

'''
Skewness is a measure of asymmetry of a distribution.
In a normal distribution, the mean divides the curve symmetrically into two equal parts at the median and the value of skewness is zero.
· When a distribution is asymmetrical the tail of the distribution is skewed to one side-to the right or to the left.
· When the value of the skewness is negative, the tail of the distribution is longer towards the left hand side of the curve.
· When the value of the skewness is positive, the tail of the distribution is longer towards the right hand side of the curve
'''

skewness = data.skew(axis = 0)
print('skewness of data: {}'.format(skewness))

######### Problem 6 #############
# Confirmation of distribution

plt.text(50000,100, 'kurtosis = '+str(kurt_lotarea)  , fontsize=10)

plt.show()

print('This gives a more clear picture where we can compare the counts even when the value of counts differ a lot from each other.')

'''
If we are using the absolute value of counts, samples with larger values will influence the model more due to their large “magnitude”
If you take log of data, the resulting value will reduce the range of the variable while “preserving” the differences.
